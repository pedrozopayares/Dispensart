# DEBT — no-carry ledger

Policy: no change archives with unsettled blocker/major debt. Minor debt carries max 1 change, then blocks.
An open major blocks the archive whether the change caused it or only discovered it. **Every debt requires
human review** — the Orchestrator keeps rows accurate and says which archives wait on what; it never
invents a category that lets them through.

Ids: `D-<shard>-<n>`, see `openspec/ID-CONVENTION.md`. On a merge conflict in this file: keep both rows.

## Open
